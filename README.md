# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

This project uses Deep Learning models to provide accuracy of an image dataset. The dataset consists of images of chest X-rays divided into two sets of images : "PNEUMONIA" and "NORMAL" . We make use of CNN , RESNET and VGG-19 models to predict whether an x-ray depicts pneumonia or not.
